hi, I am daiyi，from Soochow university ,functional material major. when I graduated from school 4 years ago, it is difficult for me to find a good job. In the market ,which job I can choose are the sales. or worker in chemical factories.  Many of my classmates chose as the sales.   by accident.  I enter a trainning scholl in shanghai for linux operation; it toke me three monthes.  After then, I started my career as a software engineer.  In my first two jobs. I worked as a linux operation engineer , always worked with the monitor system.  as time goes by, I realised it is easily replaced to work as a simple linux operationr engineer,  you must know something like developing language. maybe python, maybe java.  as you know the code logic behind the business， you can do the operation  well.     different component to reproduce a new car
